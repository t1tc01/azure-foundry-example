## Setup Instructions

1.  **Select a Site:** Choose a flat, clear area. Avoid sharp objects and low-lying areas where water could pool.
2.  **Unpack and Unroll:** Lay out the tent body flat on the ground with the floor side down.
3.  **Assemble Poles:** Connect the sections of the shock-corded poles. You will have two long main poles and one shorter ridge pole.
4.  **Insert Main Poles:** Slide the two long main poles into the pole sleeves on the top of the tent body, forming an 'X' shape.
5.  **Raise the Tent:**
    *   Flex the poles into an arch.
    *   Insert the end of each pole into the grommets at the four corners of the tent.
    *   The tent will now be standing.
6.  **Attach Clips:** Attach the plastic clips on the tent body to the poles to give it its shape.
7.  **Attach Ridge Pole:** Place the shorter ridge pole across the top, fitting into the pockets above the doors. This provides more headroom and stability.
8.  **Attach the Rainfly:**
    *   Drape the rainfly over the tent body. Make sure the rainfly door aligns with the tent door.
    *   Secure the corners of the rainfly to the buckles at the tent corners.
    *   Tighten the straps.
9.  **Stake out the Tent:**
    *   Pull out the stake loops at the base of the tent and stake them firmly into the ground at a 45-degree angle.
    *   Stake out the guylines for added stability in windy conditions.
